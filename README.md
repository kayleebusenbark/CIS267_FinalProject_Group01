This is a 2d rpg top down game. 

A long standing prophecy foretells that only three mystical gems – the Emerald, Sapphire, and Ruby – can end a curse before it takes over the citizens village.
You play as a brave knight from the village who was chosen to retrieve 3 gems from the dangerous and hidden corners of the kingdom – the forest, cavern, castle.
Goal: Collect all gems, defeat 2 mini- bosses at the end of the first two levels and defeat the evil wizard/sorcerer (main antagonist) that is behind this to prevent evil magic like this from happening again.
